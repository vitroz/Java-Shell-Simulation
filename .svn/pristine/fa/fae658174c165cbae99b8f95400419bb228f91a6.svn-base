What do I plan to do now?
	-I added minor code to get the commands to run again with our new design, which was call the getCmd method 
	 on the interpreter instance and aftewards call the run method on it.(By the way props to Eduardo, the JShell class looks so clean now! ;)
	 also I changed the verify method on the interpreter class a little bit, because we were capitalizing 
	 the command before the verify execution, so it would always throw an exception beacause the program wouldn't find the command in the hash.	
	- For next sprint, I plan on working on the get command.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Start on get command, not sure on how to retrieve real url's content, any guesses on how to that in java?
