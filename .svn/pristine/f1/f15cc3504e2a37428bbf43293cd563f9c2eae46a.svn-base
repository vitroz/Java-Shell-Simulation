What do I plan to do now?
	I'll work on a new design as a base for our project. 
	I figured that the interpreter class should pass each command the 
	responsibility of parsing parameters in order to make it more flexible 
	and easy to test. That is now needed once we have very different parameters 
	(arguments, paths, etc.). And I've also created the tests for the 
	interpreter class.
	Another thing I'd like to point out is the commands already created. Although
	I haven't touched any of those classes, they might not be working
	right now, because of this structural changing. We have to transfer the logic
	in the runs methods to constructors (but that isn't hard at all, almost
	a copy and paste as long as I see).

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Need to define a new backlog and sprints
