What did I do last time?
	- Finished Sprint2

What do I plan to do now?
	- Solve the problems with CD I was stuck at.
	- Take a look at the problems my teammates are having and solve them
	- Improve TextFile class
	- Start sprint 3 commands

Am I blocked on anything?
 - Handle the error messages
 - Echo command should be tested with right operators
  - Actually, we should find a way to validate the arguments
 - Figuring out how to start with testing
