What did I do last time?
	- Added "Commands" class and the actual commands extending it, as subclasses in a separate package "cmd".

What do I plan to do now?
	- Implement code in the subclasses.

Am I blocked on anything?
	- Not yet. As soon as we continue working on the commands, we expect to have some obstacles!
