What did I work on last time?
-- traversal commands; cleaned up the pwd.java code for a correct display;
-- added comments to clarify confusing code
-- changed root --> "/" as it was never intended to be displayed as a name;
complies with proper naming conventions

What do I plan to work on now?
-- messing around with the DirectoryTree.java class as it is responsible for
correctly tranversing file paths which are important to the success of the 
CD, MV, and CP commands.


Am I blocked on anything?
-- Having trouble accessing the root folder for commands such as 'cd /',
as well as sarting anything off with a full path -- relative paths seem fine.
