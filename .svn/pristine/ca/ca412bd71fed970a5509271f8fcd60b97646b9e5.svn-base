What did I do last time?
	- Finished Sprint 3
	- Started JUnit tests
	- Implemented the code for PwdTest and CdTest

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish JUnit tests
  	

Am I blocked on anything?
 - Commands that take more than 1 parameters(cp,echo,mv) are proving to be a little more tricky to test..
