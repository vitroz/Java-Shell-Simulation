What did I do last time?
	- Finished Sprint2

What do I plan to do now?
	- Implement missing crc cards and commands (crc for Directory Tree and 'man' command)
	- Work on some bug solving.. in cp, cat and ls
	

Am I blocked on anything?
 	- getting cat to actually display the contents of a file in the current directory
 	- ls works, but it keeps giving nullPointerException when executed from inside a directory different than root. Trying to do a validation for that.
