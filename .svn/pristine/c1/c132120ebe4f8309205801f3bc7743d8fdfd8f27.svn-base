What did I work on last time?
-- Worked on 'man' command class to adhere to polymorphism

What do I plan to work on now?
-- Seems to be an issue with the more important commands.
-- I hope to dive into 'cp', 'cd', 'mv' commands to solve issues regarding the
   more complicated test cases (non-base cases)


Am I blocked on anything?
-- Conflicts with 'man' command, probably dealing with different
   implementations of the new code
