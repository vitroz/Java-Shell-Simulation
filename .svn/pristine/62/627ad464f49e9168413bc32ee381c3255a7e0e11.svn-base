What did I work on last time?
-- Attempting to finish the traversal for copying and moving files for 
Assignment2A. Ran into some 
difficulties when interacting with the root node.

What do I plan to work on now?
-- understanding and implementing Get class, plus the LS -r flag class. 
I primarily worked on the LS class as it was crucial for traversal through
DirectoryTree.


Am I blocked on anything?
-- Not at the moment
