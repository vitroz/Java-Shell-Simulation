What did I work on last time?
-- I added mock File, Directory and TextFile classes (TextFile to be useful for using the command cat on specific types of files)

What do I plan to work on now?
-- Since this current sprint (Sprint1) includes the implementation of the cat class, this is a very important file to focus on as it creates files needed for
most of the other commands to work. So I plan to focus on the interaction between the file class and the cat command. 

Am I blocked on anything?
-- No
