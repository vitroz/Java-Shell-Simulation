What did I work on last time?
-- I worked on Pwd.java, Ls.java
What do I plan to work on now?
-- Continue on the non-trivial commands, particularly the ones that allow a
path instead of a direct file/directory name to execute the command.
Am I blocked on anything?
-- Figuring out how to incorporate path into command strings, and extracting 
the neccessary directory names to start traversing the path, and validating
every "step" of the path.
