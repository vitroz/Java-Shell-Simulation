What did I work on last time?
-- Directory and File classes

What do I plan to work on now?
-- Going over several files, including the DirectoryTree which was added as a
traversable structure for which we need to utilize for commands such as cd, 
cp, mv. 
-- I plan to jump ahead to Sprint 3, as Sprint2 is wrapping up. 
-- Need to help solve other's conflicts, especially regarding the traversing 
of the DirectoryTree when copying file.
-- Will start with an abundance of comments, transitioning to code

Am I blocked on anything?
-- No, however just figuring out the double dot and single dot parsing of an 
argument for the cd command 
ex. (cd .. traverses to the previous directory)
    (cd ./ current directory  [you can attach a path to this as well])
