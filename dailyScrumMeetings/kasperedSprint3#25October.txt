What did I do last time?
  - Correct Ls Command - it can receive a path
	- Work on some validation
	- Delete Get Command because it's not being used anymore

What do I plan to do now?
  - Finish the base cases for mkdir
  - Finish the base cases for mv
  - Finish the base cases for cp
  - Correct the base case for echo

Am I blocked on anything?
 - Validating different paths are hard, so it needs some work
