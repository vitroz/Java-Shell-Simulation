What did I do last time?
	- Finished Sprint1

What do I plan to do now?
	- Structure the project to start implementing commands
  	- Work on sprint 2 (cp cat)

Am I blocked on anything?
 - Showing just one error message whenever the path to directory does not exist
 - Right now, I'am creating a file inside the function (cp and cat), the right way to do this would be retrieving an existing file from
   an existing array of files inside a "Directory" and passing it as a parameter. We have the abstraction already, should be ready shortly. 
   The main structure is there.

Note: We were pair programming the structural part
