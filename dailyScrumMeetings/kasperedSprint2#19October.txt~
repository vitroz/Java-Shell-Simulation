What did I do last time?
	- Finished Sprint1

What do I plan to do now?
	- Structure the project to start implementing commands
  - Work on sprint 2 (Cd Command)
  - Backlog redone so the tests are the last thing we're going to do 

Am I blocked on anything?
 - Showing just one error message whenever the path to directory does not exist
 - Tests
Note: We were pair programming the structural part
