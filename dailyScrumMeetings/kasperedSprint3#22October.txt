What did I do last time?
	- Solve the problems with CD I was stuck at.
	- Improve TextFile class
	- Start sprint 3 commands

What do I plan to do now?
	- Finish exit command
  - Finish Ls Command
  - Help Ghan out with pwd command

Am I blocked on anything?
 - Mkdir needs more testing
 - As Timothy says, the paths are a problem. We have to figure out a way to
    do that easily
 - We need to organize JShell better. There's too many responsabilitie on it
