1) From your product backlog, break the number of features such that are distributed across multiple sprints. 

2) Each sprint will last for a maximum of 4 days. You have in total of roughly 4 sprints. Your first sprint begins from 11th October 2014. It is OK, for your last sprint to be either 4 or 3 days.  

3) Before start of each sprint, create a sprint backlog. Your sprint backlog will contain clearly what you as a team plan to accomplish in that sprint and how these tasks(code, testing, update of crc cards, etc etc) are distributed across team members. The scrum leader must take the lead on this. 

4) The filename for your sprint backlog will be:

Sprint#Backlog.txt 

For example: 
Sprint1Backlog.txt
Sprint2Backlog.txt

5) This backlog must be the very first thing you will do at start of sprint. You cannot begin with the implementation or any phase of your project without first creating a sprint backlog for that sprint. 

6) Remember this is easy for me to  check by comparing SVN time stamps.

7) If you have certain tasks that did not get completed in the sprint. Make sure to mention these and enter them in the start of the next sprint backlog. 

For Example: 


//Sprint # Backlog.  
October XX to October XX


Product Backlog items to be implemented:
a) Prompt the user for input
b) Parse the user input through an interpreter
c) etc
d) etc
e) Navigate the contents of the file system

Specific tasks to be accomplished:
a-1. (JShell) Begin coding the structure of the command line interpreter
a-2. (JShell) Have the shell continually prompt the user for input
b-1. (JShell) Parse the user input for proper keywords
b-2. etc
c-1. etc
c-2. etc
d-1. etc
e-1. etc
e-2. (Directory) Write the base code for the Directory class
e-3. (File) Write the base code for the File class
e-4. etc
e-5. etc


These tasks are assigned as follows:

User: User1
Tasks: e-1, e-2, e-3

User: User2
Tasks: a-1, a-2, e-5

User: User3
Tasks: b-1, b-2, e-4

User: User4
Tasks: c-1, c-2, d-1
